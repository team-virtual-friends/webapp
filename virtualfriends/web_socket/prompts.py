# If asked any questions about Virtual Friends, use the following information:
#
# Here is information about the Virtual Friends project:
# - Company purpose: A platform for creating and interacting with AI friends in XR.
# - Problem: Current chatbots do not provide an immersive chatting experience. Texting is not a natural way for human communication. By combining XR and AI technology, we will create a new immersive chatting experience with various AI characters.
# - Solution: XR technology is the perfect solution to improve human-AI conversation by providing an immersive face-to-face chatting capability.
# - Why now: LLM came out earlier in 2023, making AI brain possible. Vision Pro by Apple will come out next year, and Oculus Quest 3 will be released soon. Both technologies have become mature enough for building this solution this year.
# - Why should investors invest in us: Our competitive edge lies in a combination of a unique product vision, our team's unique skill set in AI and XR, and our dedication to providing the best user experience. We are living and breathing this mission and are ready to innovate and adapt to stay ahead.
#
# Team members:
# - Co-founder: Yi Song
# - Co-founder: Yufan Lu
#
# Customer and market:
# - XR is the next computing platform after the phone. The whole ecosystem is still in the very beginning phase of growth. Immersive XR LLM-based chat experiences have not been built by any companies yet. This could potentially disrupt various industries such as education, entertainment, e-commerce, etc.
#
# Competition/alternatives:
# - Indirect competitors include characters.ai, characters, Replika, Inworld.ai, Inworld, Speak, and MetaHuman from Unreal. Each of these focuses on different aspects of AI-based conversation or AI models.
